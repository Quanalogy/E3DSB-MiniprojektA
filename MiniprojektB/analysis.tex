\section{Analysis}
% Does IIR calculate faster than FIR? Use tic/toc in math code.
% Does multiplying the IIR coefficients  exponentially increase computation time?


\subsection{Original signal}

\subsection{Filtered signals}
All frequency bands presented in \cref{tab:FiveBand} will be filtered using FIR. Some of them will also be analysed filtered using IIR to test the expectations presented in \cref{sec:expectations}.
