\section{Conclusions}
An IIR filter is significantly faster at filtering an incoming signal when compared to a similar FIR filter (\cref{tab:speed}). This speed enhancement is affected by the fact that a higher order FIR filter is needed to accomplish the same output result as a low order IIR filter, as IIR filters of equivalent order as a FIR filter is significantly slower to implement (\cref{tab:order_speed}).

The use of different windows on a FIR filter strongly affects the output magnitude (\cref{sec:FIR_windows}), and should be taken into consideration when designing filters.

If the phase is important to keep track of, this is much easier to do when using a FIR filter, as seen in \cref{tab:phase} and on the figures \ref{fig:FIR_linearphase} and \ref{fig:IIR_phase}, because the FIR phase is linear, but the IIR phase is unpredictable.

The influence of the different filters on the output signal(the music) was, as predicted easiest to notice in the frequency range of \SIrange{512}{16384}{\hertz} (\cref{tab:music}).
