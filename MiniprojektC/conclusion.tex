\section{Conclusion}
This miniproject has proven that with the use of filters, we can manipulate the sound signal, but if you want to make the changes to the voice as the focus were, some more work has to be done - like moving the frequencies after doing the fourier transform. This project has not turned out to change the voices as expected but an important lesson regarding the order of IIR and FIR filters were learned.
