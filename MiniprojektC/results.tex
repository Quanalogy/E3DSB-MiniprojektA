\section{Results}
In section "\nameref{sec:analysis}" the data analysis have been done, in this section a discussion upon the effects to the sound samples will be made. First off a highpass filter were applied. The first thing noticed were that the sound level were lowered a lot. The voice sounded like if someone had recorded it from far away. When put on replay a couple of times, it is also apparent that the two samples have lost some detail in the voice - which would also be expected when filtering out some of the frequencies. None of the two samples sounded like it had "changed gender", it just sounds distorded and far away. The same applies for the bandpass and the male voice, the female does sound a bit different with the bandpass, it actually sounds like her voice is even further away than with the highpass filter.
