\section{Introduction}
In this miniproject a man's and a woman's speach will be under study. This project will aim to test whether applying a filter of the opposite gender and enhancing these filtered frequencies, would make it sound more like the opposite gender.

\paragraph{Expectations} to this project is that the filtered voice will make a noticable change but it will most likely not make the woman sound like a man and vice versa.
