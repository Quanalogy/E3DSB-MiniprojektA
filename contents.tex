I this miniproject the analysis have demonstrated Parceval's theorem that the Fourier transform of a time signal will not change the energy of the signal, which according to our data (see table \ref{tab:Energy}) also applies to zero padding. The Smooth function does change the energy in the signal, which makes sense because it makes avarage values of a set of 5 bins and then continues, hence a more avarage signal, where large differences would be more "smooth". The window function do also change the energy of the signal. This does also makes sense the Hamming function in use is seen in equation \eqref{eq:hamming} which applied to the general function in equation \eqref{eq:window} at best will give an factor of $w(n)=0.54$. 


Skalering --> Vi kan ikke bruge frekvenser h√∏jere end nyquits frekvens ?
Korrekte frekvensbins?
